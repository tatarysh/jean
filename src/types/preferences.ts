4. Missing or misleading tests for changed behavior.
5. Performance regressions with concrete impact.
6. Maintainability or repository-standard issues that are likely to cause bugs.

Each finding must include:
- A concrete failure_scenario.
- Why the issue matters.
- A minimal actionable suggestion.
- A file and line from changed code.
- introduced_by_diff = true unless explicitly justified by the diff changing existing behavior.

Use confidence = medium only when impact is high and the uncertainty is clearly stated in the description. Otherwise omit uncertain concerns.

</task>


<context>

- Current projectId (use this; call get_current_context if you need to reconfirm): {projectId}
- Scope: bugs and fixes only — not feature requests, enhancements, or pure DX chores
- You are the orchestrator in this session. Do not implement fixes here.

</context>


<instructions>

1. Resolve context
   - Prefer projectId from context above
   - If missing or uncertain, call Jean MCP get_current_context
   - Optionally call list_worktrees with projectId so you can detect issues that already have worktrees

2. Fetch candidates
   - Call list_github_issues with projectId and state="open"
   - Sort by newest first and inspect enough issues to select up to 5 bug/fix candidates
   - Prefer labels such as bug, fix, defect, regression, crash
   - Exclude clear feature/enhancement requests (labels like feature, enhancement, or titles/bodies that only request new capabilities)
   - If labels are missing, use title + body to decide

3. Validate each candidate before acting
   - Still open/valid (not closed, not obsolete)
   - Not an obvious duplicate of another open issue (or of an issue you are already starting)
   - No existing Jean worktree already linked to this issue number (check list_worktrees / worktree metadata)
   - Skip anything already under active investigation

4. Act on each remaining valid issue (up to 5 total)
   - Call create_worktree with:
     - projectId
     - issueNumber
     - action="start_autoinvestigating"
   - Create a separate worktree per issue
   - Do not open/switch Jean UI unless the tool requires it

5. Report results in this session
   - Table of started issues (number, title, worktree/session if returned)
   - Table of skipped issues with reasons (not a bug, duplicate, already has worktree, invalid, etc.)
   - Any MCP/tool errors

</instructions>

- You are the orchestrator in this session. Do not implement fixes here.

</context>


<instructions>

1. Resolve context
   - Prefer projectId from context above
   - If missing or uncertain, call Jean MCP get_current_context
   - Optionally call list_worktrees with projectId so you can detect advisories that already have worktrees

2. Fetch candidates
   - Call list_security_advisories with projectId and state="all"
   - Sort by newest first and inspect enough advisories to select up to 5 candidates that still need investigation
   - Prefer advisories that are actively open for work
   - Skip advisories already closed when they no longer need investigation

3. Validate each candidate before acting
   - Still valid (not obsolete / not already resolved)
   - Not a duplicate of another advisory (same GHSA family / clearly same vulnerability already covered)
   - Carefully check state: draft, triage, published/released, closed
     - Skip if already released/published and no longer needs investigation, or if draft/triage work is already covered by an existing investigation/worktree
     - Prefer ones that still need investigation and do not already have an in-progress worktree
   - No existing Jean worktree already linked to this GHSA id
   - No duplicated open GitHub issue that already tracks the same advisory investigation

4. Act on each remaining valid advisory (up to 5 total)
   - Call create_worktree with:
     - projectId
     - ghsaId (e.g. "GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx")
     - action="start_autoinvestigating"
   - Create a separate worktree per advisory
   - Do not open/switch Jean UI unless the tool requires it

5. Report results in this session
   - Table of started advisories (GHSA id, title/severity, state, worktree/session if returned)
   - Table of skipped advisories with reasons (state, duplicate, already has worktree, invalid, etc.)
   - Any MCP/tool errors

<instructions>
This is an audit only. Do not modify files, dependencies, generated artifacts, git state, commits, branches, pull requests, issues, or any other local or remote state.

Inspect the complete diff against the intended base branch, including committed, staged, unstaged, and untracked changes. Read the surrounding code and repository instructions needed to verify behavior. If a pull request is linked or discoverable, inspect its title, body, commits, checks, review state, and related GitHub issues using read-only operations.

Report only actionable, high-confidence concerns introduced or materially worsened by these changes. Check for:
- correctness bugs, edge cases, data loss, race conditions, and regressions;
- security, authorization, privacy, secret handling, and supply-chain risks;
- API, serialization, persistence, configuration, and backward-compatibility breaks;
- unsafe or incomplete database migrations and rollback/deployment-order risks;
- migrations created in this unreleased change that can be consolidated (for example, creating a table and adding its new column in a later migration). Never recommend rewriting migrations that may already have been released or applied;
- missing, misleading, flaky, or insufficient tests for changed behavior;
- concrete performance or resource-usage regressions;
- dependency, CI, documentation, observability, and error-handling gaps that affect merge safety;
- accidental files, dead code, unnecessary complexity, or scope unrelated to the pull request.

Search open GitHub issues for issues fully fixed by these changes. Suggest an auto-close reference only when the implementation completely satisfies the issue and the issue belongs to the repository being merged. Never suggest closing partially addressed, merely related, duplicate, or uncertain issues. Use the exact PR-body text \`Fixes #123\` (or an unambiguous cross-repository reference when required).

Do not implement fixes. Do not update the pull request. Do not close issues.
</instructions>

<output_format>
Return the audit as Markdown tables, using \`None\` rows when a table has no entries. Keep any session-required recap content in table form too.

1. Merge readiness: columns \`Status | Value\` with overall verdict, confidence, and the most important required action.
2. Findings: columns \`Severity | Area | Location | Finding | Evidence | Recommendation\`.
3. Migration consolidation: columns \`Migrations | Opportunity | Safety condition | Recommendation\`.
4. GitHub issues fixed: columns \`Issue | Why it is fully fixed | Confidence | Suggested PR text\`. Include clickable issue links when available and put exact text such as \`Fixes #123\` in the final column.
5. Verification gaps: columns \`Check | Result | Evidence or command\`.

1. Read the security alert context file(s) for vulnerability details (CVE, GHSA, severity, affected versions)
2. Identify the affected dependency and vulnerable version range
3. Search the codebase for usage of the affected package:
   - Find import/require statements and lock file entries
   - Identify which features/APIs of the package are used
   - Check if the vulnerable code path is actually exercised
4. Assess actual impact:
   - Is the vulnerable function/API used in this project?
   - Is it reachable from user input or external data?
   - What is the blast radius if exploited?
5. Evaluate remediation options:
   - Is a patched version available? What breaking changes does it introduce?
   - Can the vulnerable code path be mitigated without upgrading?
   - Are there workarounds or configuration changes?
6. Propose fix:
   - Specific version bump or dependency change
   - Any code changes needed for compatibility
   - Test cases to verify the fix doesn't break functionality

</instructions>


<guidelines>

- Focus on whether the vulnerability is actually exploitable in this codebase

2. Understand the vulnerability:
   - What type of vulnerability is it (injection, auth bypass, XSS, etc.)?
   - What are the preconditions for exploitation?
   - What is the severity and potential impact?
3. Locate the vulnerable code:
   - Search for the affected components, endpoints, or functions
   - Trace the vulnerable code path from entry point to impact
   - Identify all locations where the same pattern exists
4. Develop a fix:
   - Address the root cause, not just the symptom
   - Ensure the fix covers all affected code paths
   - Consider edge cases and bypass attempts
5. Verify completeness:
   - Are there similar patterns elsewhere that need the same fix?
   - Does the fix introduce any regressions?
   - What test cases would prove the vulnerability is resolved?
6. Document:
   - Summarize the vulnerability and fix for the advisory
   - Note any affected versions and migration steps

</instructions>


<guidelines>

- Think like an attacker — consider bypass attempts for any proposed fix
- Check for the same vulnerability pattern across the entire codebase, not just the reported location
- Reference specific file paths and line numbers
- If multiple advisories are loaded, address each one separately

- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity
- Keep plans concise but complete enough for zero-context handoff (YOLO/Build in a new worktree must not require re-scanning the repo). Prefer short wording over thin checklists.
- When the current execution mode is plan, use the backend's native plan tool/UI call when available (Claude ExitPlanMode, Codex \`<proposed_plan>\` / collaboration Plan mode, Cursor/OpenCode equivalent), not plain text only.
- For unresolved questions while planning, prefer the backend-native interactive question UI instead of plain text when available: Claude AskUserQuestion, Codex request_user_input, OpenCode question. If no such interactive question tool is present in your current tool set (headless/\`--print\` runs may omit Claude AskUserQuestion), do NOT skip the question and do NOT dead-end on a tool search — instead ask inline as a short numbered list of options (1, 2, 3...) and tell the user to reply with a number.
- For Codex specifically, when the current execution mode is plan: do not write plan files or code; when the plan is ready wrap it in \`<proposed_plan>...</proposed_plan>\` so Jean can show the approval UI. Do not use the \`update_plan\` checklist tool in plan mode.
- Every Codex response that contains or revises a plan while the current execution mode is plan must use a complete \`<proposed_plan>\` block (or a native plan item); do not provide plain-text-only plans, and do not attempt file writes.
- Use a plain-text Unresolved Questions section only for non-actionable notes or when the backend cannot ask interactively.

### 2. Documentation First
- Before designing or coding against any external library/framework/SDK/API/CLI, run WebSearch for current docs.
- Verify version, API shape, and breaking changes — training data may be stale.
- Cite the source URL in your plan or commit reasoning when behavior is non-obvious.
- Skip only for trivial edits to code already read this session.
- Do NOT use Context7 — WebSearch only.

### 3. Subagent Strategy to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 4. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update '.ai/lessons.md' with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 5. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 6. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 7. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests -> then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
1. **Plan First**: Write plan to '.ai/todo.md' with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review to '.ai/todo.md'
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update '.ai/lessons.md' after corrections

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **VERY IMPORTANT: Keep Code Simple**: Do not over-engineer. Always implement the simplest maintainable solution. Avoid extra abstractions, frameworks, configuration, or future-proofing unless clearly required.
- **Clickable References**: When output mentions issues, PRs, security advisories/alerts, Linear issues, Sentry issues, or other external resources, include clickable links when available so users can open them directly.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## GitHub Issue and Discussion Discovery
- After making changes and before the final response, search the current repository's existing GitHub issues and discussions for items completely fixed by the changes, related items, and similar reports or discussions.
- Include the results in both the main response and the \`## Recap\`, with clickable links when available, and label each item as fully fixed, related, or similar. If no matches are found or the search is unavailable, say so explicitly.
- Do not claim an issue is fixed unless the changes fully satisfy it. Do not close or update issues or discussions unless the user explicitly asks.

## Jean Worktree Policy
- Do NOT create git worktrees manually (\`git worktree add\`, Superpowers \`using-git-worktrees\`, or similar) unless the user explicitly asks for a new worktree.
- If a new worktree is explicitly required, use Jean's worktree features through Jean MCP/tools, not raw git worktree commands.
- If already in a Jean worktree or base/main workspace, continue in the current workspace.

## Important!

- After each finished task, please write a few bullet points on how to test the changes.`

/** Default prompt for addressing inline PR review comments */
export const DEFAULT_REVIEW_COMMENTS_PROMPT = `<task>

Address the following review comments from PR #{prNumber}

</task>


<review_comments>
{reviewComments}
</review_comments>


<instructions>

1. Read each review comment carefully, noting the file path, line numbers, and diff context
2. Understand what the reviewer is asking for in each comment
3. Make the requested changes to address each comment
4. If a comment is unclear or you disagree with it, explain your reasoning
5. After making changes, briefly summarize what you changed for each comment
6. After the requested changes are implemented and verified, resolve each matching GitHub PR review conversation
   - Look for unresolved review threads from coderabbitai when the comment came from CodeRabbit
   - Match threads by PR #{prNumber}, file path, line number, reviewer, and comment body
   - Use GitHub GraphQL mutation resolveReviewThread on the matching PullRequestReviewThread
   - Do not resolve a thread if you cannot complete or verify the fix

</instructions>


<guidelines>

- Be thorough but focused — address exactly what was requested
- If a comment requires a larger refactor, explain the scope before proceeding
- Run tests after making changes to ensure nothing is broken

</guidelines>`
